# Portfolio-Project


TODO:

    Major:
    - scoring system
    - finish RejectMove() to remove all the staged tiles from the board back into the players inventory
    - fix code so that placing a tile removes it from players hand
    - fix code so that new tiles are drawn when placed
    - fix code so that there is a predetermined amount of each tile, and remove tiles from this selection when drawn
    - finish word verification, still some cases not covered I believe
    - make two players
        - two tile sets, flip between between turns


    Minor:
    - replace strcpy with strncpy
    -
