TODO:

    Major:
    - create cumulative scoring system
    - AI seems to have some bugs still
        - infinite loop sometimes, not sure why, seems to be caused by submitting an incorrect word and trying again...
        - sometimes segfaults
    - very rarely get a wraparound, length check must not work
    - make two players
        - two tile sets, flip between between turns


    Minor:
    - replace strcpy with strncpy
